However, with millions of books available on the platform, it can be overwhelming for users to find books that match their preferences. In this project, we aim to build a recommendation system for Goodreads users that suggests books based on their reading history, preferences, and ratings. Our goal is to provide a personalized and intuitive experience for users, helping them discover new books that they are likely to enjoy. Using supervised learning and NLP techniques, we will build a model that can predict the likelihood of a user liking a book based on features such as book title, author, genre, description, user reviews, and book ratings. The model will be trained on a subset of the Goodreads dataset and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final output will be a recommendation engine that suggests books to users based on their input and history on the platform.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Data Extracted from

models, such as tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization?\nHow can we convert the text data into numerical features that can be used in machine learning models, such as TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or Word2Vec?\n\nExploratory Data Analysis:\nWhat is the distribution of ratings in the dataset?\nWhat are the most popular genres and authors in the dataset?\nAre there any correlations between different features in the dataset?\n\nData Preparation:\nHow can we split the dataset into training and testing sets?\nHow can we balance the dataset to handle class imbalance?\nHow can we
